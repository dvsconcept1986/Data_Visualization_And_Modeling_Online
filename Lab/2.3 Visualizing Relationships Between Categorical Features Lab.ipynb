    "You have been hired by James Cameron to create profiles of two characters for a reboot of the Titanic Movie: one that is most likely to survive the sinking and one that is least likely to survive.  Mr. Cameron wants this reboot to be as historically accurate as possible, so your profile of each character should be backed up with data and visualizations.\n",

    "Each character profile should include information on their:\n",

    "* Passenger class\n",
    "* Travel companions (including both parents/children and siblings/spouse)\n",
    "* Port of departure (indicated by the Embarked feature in the dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "For quantitative features like `Age` and `Fare`, you will need to use the `.loc` method we learned in class (or something similar) to place individuals in categories.  How you choose to do this is up to you, but make sure you explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should include at least one visualization for each element of the character profile (age, sex, passenger class, etc.) as evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have developed your two character profiles, use your Pandas data wrangling skills to identify at least one real passenger in the dataset that fits each profile.  Print out the names of these individuals.  Look them up in [Encyclopeida Titanica](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/) (or a similar resource).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tell Mr. Cameron at least one thing about the real passengers who fit your two character profiles that you learned from an external resource.  You need one interesting fact about a person who fits the profile of \"most likely to survive\" and one interesting fact about a person who fits the profile of \"least likely to surivive\".  \n",

    "1. \"WILLIE\" - THE SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER:\n",
    "   Despite being a poor laborer, William Henry Saundercock (known as \"Willie\")\n",
    "   was deeply religious and active in his community. He was a Sunday School\n",
    "   teacher at the Wesleyan Church in St. Austell, Cornwall, where he was\n",
    "   described as having an \"amiable and courteous disposition.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TEMPERANCE ADVOCATE & FREEMASON:\n",
    "   Willie was a member of St. Austell's Rechabite Lodge (a temperance\n",
    "   organization) and a Freemason. He was also a popular reciter at Band of\n",
    "   Hope meetings (a children's temperance organization). Before leaving for\n",
    "   America, he was presented with a Sunday School teacher's Bible as a gift\n",
    "   from his congregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. TRAVELING WITH A FRIEND:\n",
    "   Willie boarded the Titanic with his friend Ernest Charles Cann, also a\n",
    "   china clay laborer from St. Austell. Both were seeking better opportunities\n",
    "   in America. Tragically, both young men perished in the sinking. Neither of\n",
    "   their bodies were ever recovered or identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. THE CLAY MINING COMMUNITY:\n",
    "   Willie was part of a small community of Cornish clay workers traveling\n",
    "   together on the Titanic. At least four men from St. Austell (including\n",
    "   William Nancarrow and William John Matthews) were aboard. This was common -\n",
    "   working-class communities would often travel together seeking opportunities\n",
    "   in America.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. FAMILY AFTERMATH:\n",
    "   Willie's parents, Richard and Kate Saundercock, received a grant of £20\n",
    "   from the Mansion House Relief Fund after his death - a pittance compared\n",
    "   to the financial support wealthier families received. His sister Edith\n",
    "   later married the son of another Titanic victim (William Nancarrow),\n",
    "   creating a tragic bond between two families devastated by the disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIGNIFICANCE FOR YOUR FILM:\n",
    "William Saundercock represents the forgotten victims of the Titanic - the\n",
    "young working-class men seeking a better life who stood no chance when the\n",
    "\"women and children first\" policy was enforced. He was a good man, deeply\n",
    "religious, with strong moral character, but his poverty and class status\n",
    "sealed his fate. His story shows how the Titanic disaster disproportionately\n",
    "affected the poorest passengers.\n",
    "\"\"\")\n"
